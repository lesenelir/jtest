jest tutorial - some test examples written with Jest

### Test Driven Development ( TDD ) 
Test Falls -> Test Passes -> Refactor -> Test Falls ...

> TDD mode is wildly used in utility functions
> 
> Test cases is always the use cases. You can also look at the test cases ( use cases ) as a documentation for the function ~ 
  -  pure function scenarios ( Easy to think of input and output )
  -  BUG fixing scenarios ( when encountering a bug, write a test case to reproduce the bug, then fix the bug )
  -  UI interaction scenarios ( use test to simulate user interaction, then implement the main logic )

### Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

First, develop the main logic, then write the test cases to test the important part.
